This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle bug in Python related to handling empty lists when calculating the average of numbers. The bug lies in how the function responds to an empty input, potentially leading to unexpected results in applications where explicit error handling or alternative actions (like raising an exception) would be more suitable. The solution showcases a more robust approach.
